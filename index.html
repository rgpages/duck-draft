				</figure>
<p>Yet, even after a coaching change when Willie Taggart said he was wiping the slate clean, all three players decided to skip a paycheck and return for their senior season and learn a new offense. All three were coming off a sub-par season and likely did not get the draft grade they wanted before deciding to return to campus to try to improve their stock.</p>
<p>With Freeman, Carrington and Crosby off the board, NFL teams passed on the Ducks for the first time since 1985</p>
<p>But the year after Oregon's last NFL draft shutout, three Ducks were taken in 1986 to start a run of 31 straight years with a selection.</p>
<p>Oregon looks certain to get back in the draft next year with a few players capable of joining Freeman, Carrington and Crosby in mock drafts if they have a strong season.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 10 Ducks who could put themselves in position to be drafted next year:</strong></p>

						<h4 class="name">Senior running back Royce Freeman</h4>
						<div>
							<p><strong>From the moment he stepped on campus</strong> and ran for 1,365 yards and 18 scores while leading Oregon to the College Football Playoff as a true freshman, he looked physically ready to play in the pros. When he ran for 1,836 yards and 17 touchdowns as a sophomore, it appeared a lock that Freeman would leave after his junior season.</p>
<p>Then injuries slowed him throughout last year when he ran for 945 yards and his draft stock slipped in a loaded class of running backs that included first-rounders Leonard Fournette and Christian McCaffrey, with Joe Mixon and Dalvin Cook going in the second round.</p>
<p>Freeman, who will break the school's career rushing record with a 1,000-yard season, was picked to go 19th in Sports Illustrated's 2018 mock draft. If he returns to form, he could be in the mix to be the first running back drafted next year.</p>

						<h4 class="name">Senior wide receiver Darren Carrington</h4>
						<div>
							<p><strong>He's 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds</strong> with NFL bloodlines, but also brings some off-the-field baggage -- including a drug suspension that forced him to miss the national championship game as a freshman and half of his sophomore season. Carrington has flashed a ton of potential, but never had more than 750 receiving yards in a season.</p>
<p>Oregon does not have a ton of experience or depth at wide receiver, so Carrington will have a chance to be a volume receiver for the Ducks. If he could translate his sophomore season when he missed the first six games into a full season, Carrington would finish with about 60 catches for 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns, numbers that would likely push him toward the top end of the draft</p>

							<p><strong>The 6-foot-5, 310-pounder played</strong> as a true freshman, but missed the final nine games of his junior season and was not fully cleared to participate in spring football.</p> 
<p>If Crosby, who is ranked as the No. 3 tackle in the draft by CBSSports.com, can regain his spot as Oregon's starting left tackle, he could move himself into the top two rounds of the draft.</p>

				<h4 class="name">Senior wide receiver Charles Nelson</h4>						<div>
<p><strong>The 5-foot-8, 177-pounder could attract</strong> teams with his versatility.</p>
<p>He has 1,151 receiving yards, including 13 touchdowns, in three seasons and averaged 24.4 yards on kickoff returns with two touchdowns while averaging 16.4 yards on punt returns with two scores. Nelson also ran for 253 yards and two touchdowns while making 65 tackles on special teams and defense, with two interceptions while playing safety as a sophomore.</p>
<p>His best chance to make an NFL roster is likely on special teams.</p>

							<p><strong>Graduate transfer from Clemson</strong> will join the Ducks in the fall and is expected to start during his lone season at Oregon.</p>
<p>Pagano started 13 games in his career with 92 tackles and won a national title last year with the Tigers. He should get more playing time with the Ducks than he got at Clemson with a chance to show off for pro scouts.</p>

							<p><strong>The 6-foot-4, 205-pounder</strong> has played cornerback and safety for the Ducks and could interest NFL teams with his size and versatility.</p>
<p>Oregon's defense doesn't have a good reputation these days, but if the unit can make a big improvement, it could improve the stock of Robinson and some other defenders. Robinson has shown an ability to be a playmaker with 153 tackles, four interceptions, two sacks, and two fumble recoveries in 40 career games.</p>

						<h4 class="name">Senior cornerback Arrion Springs</h4>

						<p><strong>Oregon has not had a defensive back selected</strong> in the first five rounds since T.J. Ward in 2010, but new defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt had three members of his secondary last year at Colorado drafted in the first four rounds of last month's draft.</p>
<p>Springs was a highly-touted recruit out of San Antonio who played as a true freshman and started 21 games in the past two seasons. But also was benched at times by defensive backs coach John Neal.</p>
<p>Springs impressed Taggart during the spring and could play his way into a pro future.

						<h4 class="name">Senior defensive lineman Henry Mondeaux</h4>

							<p><strong>At 6-5 and 280 pounds,</strong> Mondeaux looks the part of an NFL lineman and has shown the versatility to play all over the line. He is expected to play on the end this season after starting every game last year.</p>
<p>One other thing to consider: Oregon nose tackle Alex Balducci signed with the 49ers as a free agent two years ago and was converted to the offensive line. Mondeaux was recruited by colleges as a tight end out of Jesuit High School and could get a look on offense if he isn't a prospect on the defensive line.</p>

							<p><strong>Three kickers were selected last month</strong> and Schneider could be among the top three on the board next year if he repeats the success of his sophomore season when he was the all-conference kicker who made 22-of-24 kicks. Only had 12 field-goal attempts last season and likely needs more to gain enough attention to move onto draft boards.</p>

						<h4 class="name">Sophomore tight end Jacob Breeland</h4>
						<div>
							<p><strong>There are no early entries</strong> on this list so far and Oregon is unlikely to lose an underclassman to the NFL but, for a wild card, the redshirt sophomore could be intriguing if he plays as big a part of the offense as expected.</p>
							<p>He had just six catches for 123 yards in his lone season on the field, but Breeland is clearly Oregon's top tight end at an inexperienced position. The 6-5, 237-pounder has the size that NFL teams are seeking at the position.</p>
<p>Five tight ends were taken in the first two rounds last month and each stood between 6-3 and 6-6 with four of them between 234 and 251 pounds. If Breeland has a breakout season, he could become an interesting pro prospect.</p>
